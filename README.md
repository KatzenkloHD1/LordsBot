# LordsBot
A Bot program for a game called Lords Mobile.

NOTES:
The current bot is made for a game called Lords Mobile, it is a Android app game.
The bot requires the installation of NoxPlayer a Android operating system emulator, 
that allows you to run Android apps on your PC.

The Bot has the functions and is able to be modified to automate literally any program on the Windows OS using a brute force method.

Extra Notes:

Had another version of the code with comments but ended up losing it somehow.
Will be adding documentation and more incode comments when i got time.

...more info will be added later.
